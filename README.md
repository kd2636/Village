Smart Villages Hackathon App

A web application which empowers villagers(basically farmers) to put there produce (the crops they grow) online with there own price quote.

Any one who wish to buy the produce can go on to the website and meet appropriate sellers and contact them.

This eleminates the middle man and gives power directly to the farmers.

The future scope is to add push notification system, regional language support, chat bot and much more.
